Check whether a number is Perfect Number or not

Problem Statement: Perfect Number. Write a program to find whether a number is a perfect number or not.

A perfect number is defined as a number that is the sum of its proper divisors ( all its positive divisors excluding itself). 



#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    
    cout<<"Enter a Number "<<endl;
    int n;
    cin>>n;
    
    int sum=0;
    
    for(int i=1;i<n;i++)
    {
        if(n%i==0)
        {
            sum=sum+i;
        }
    }
    
    if(n==sum)
    {
        cout<<"Number is perfect"<<endl;
    }
    else
    {
        cout<<"Number is not perfect"<<endl;
    }
    
    return 0;
}



Enter a Number 
15
Number is not perfect


=== Code Execution Successful ===



Enter a Number 
6
